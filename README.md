Installation
------------
```R
devtools::install_github("walaj/rovertools")
```

Description
-----------
Range overlaps between different sets of genomic intervals
	     can be memory intensive and slow for huge (1M+) interval queries.
	     This package implements fast, memory-efficient interval tree overlaps in C++
	     and provides flexibility for users to choose only what they need,
	     thereby improving memory performance.

### NOTE
Note that the prefered input for the fastest performance is:
* Input is ``data.table`` (``GRanges`` will get converted)
* Seqnames are factors or numeric, not characters
* Input must be sorted (``data.table::setkey(dt, seqnames, start)``). An error is thrown if not.

Examples
--------
#### Get overlap intervals

```R
library(data.table)
k=1
d1 <- data.table(seqnames=factor(rep(c(1, "X"), each=k)), start=seq(k*2), end=seq(k*2)+2)
k=2
d2 <- data.table(seqnames=factor(rep(c(1, "X"), each=k)), start=seq(k*2), end=seq(k*2)+2)

o <- roverlaps::roverlaps(d1, d2)

## output
   seqnames start end query.id subject.id
1:        1     1   3        1          1 
2:        1     2   3        1          2
3:        X     3   4        2          3
4:        X     4   4        2          4
```

#### Get only the overlap bins
```R
o <- roverlaps::roverlaps(d1, d2, index_only=TRUE) 

## output
   query.id subject.id
1:        1          1 
2:        1          2
3:        2          3
4:        2          4
```

Performance
-----------

Testing overlap of 5 million vs 50 million ranges, repeated 10 times. Each 
overlap produces 24,999,997 overlaps. Comparison is between ``roverlaps`` and ``gUtils::gr.findoverlaps`` from
[gUtils][gUtils], which
is based on ``GenomicRanges::findOverlaps``.
