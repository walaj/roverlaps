Description: Range overlaps between different sets of genomic intervals
	     can be memory intensive and slow for huge (1M+) interval queries.
	     This package implements fast, memory-efficient interval tree overlaps in C++
	     and provides flexibility for users to choose only what they need,
	     thereby improving memory performance.
