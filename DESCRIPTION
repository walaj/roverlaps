Title: Fast, memory-efficient genomic range overlaps

Description: Range overlaps between different sets of genomic intervals
	     can be memory intensive and slow for huge (1M+) interval queries.
	     Depending on the application, only part of a range overlap is needed 
	     (e.g. just the overlap mappings, not the actual ranges). This package
	     implements fast, memory-efficient interval tree overlaps in C++
	     and provides flexibility for users to choose only what they need,
	     thereby improving memory performance.
